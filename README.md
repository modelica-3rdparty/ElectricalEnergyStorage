# ElectricalEnergyStorage<sup>1</sup>

(1: fka `ElectricalStorages` and `Modelica_ElectricalStorages`)

Free library that contains models with different complexity for simulating of electric energy storages like batteries (single cells as well as stacks) interacting with loads, battery management systems, loads and charging devices.

## Library description

This package contains electric energy storage models and components for modeling these storages.
A rough overview about the EnergyStorages library was presented at the Modelica conference 2011 in [A Modelica Library for Simulation of Elecric Energy Storages](http://modelica.org/events/modelica2011/Proceedings/pages/papers/17_4_ID_105_a_fv.pdf)

## Current release
